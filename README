Tk::Wizard::Sizer
=================

DESCRIPTION

A typical Wizard application utilizes a fixed-size window; Tk::Wizard
(sold separately) follows this philosophy by creating a window without
resize handles.  In addition, Tk::Wizard allows you to specify the
size of the content area.  But there's a problem with this mechanism
-- how do you know how large to make your window?  You know what you
want to appear in the window, and you know how you want it to be
arranged, but you do not know the dimensions of that combination of
elements.

Fret no more, dear programmer!  Simply install Tk::Wizard::Sizer,
replace your call to Tk::Wizard->new with a call to
Tk::Wizard::Sizer->new, and run your Wizard application.  On each
page, adjust the size of the window for best aesthetics.  After you
click the Next button on each page, on STDOUT will be printed the
ideal height and width arguments.  After you click the Finish button
on the last page, on STDOUT will be printed the ideal dimensions that
will contain all your pages (i.e. the width of the widest page and the
height of the tallest page).


INSTALLATION

This module can be installed in the normal perl way, such as:

   perl -MCPAN -e "install Tk::Wizard"

or, unpack the archive and in the new folder execute the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make all test
   make install

If you are on Windows you might have to use nmake instead of make.

If you set environment variable TEST_INTERACTIVE to any non-zero
value, most of the tests will pause and you will have to click the
"Next" button several times to get through them.
